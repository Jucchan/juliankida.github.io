# About me
I'm **Julian Kida**, a game designer and programmer. I graduated from University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science (Games) in 2021, and with a M.S. in Computer Science in 2023. My main skills are gameplay design, game prototyping, and my ability to speak Japanese natively. Aside from video games, I enjoy riichi mahjong and watching baseball/horseracing.
