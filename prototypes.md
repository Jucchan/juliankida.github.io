During Fall of 2020, I made 8 prototypes for the Game Prototyping class at USC. Each prototype was made over the course of one week, with a different theme and a different student partner. 

These prototypes taught me valuable lessons in both game design and programming. In terms of game design, I learned a good deal about the importance of game feel and "juice." My prototypes that received the most praise from my professors and peers were not the ones with the most sophisticated game loops or with the most complete features, but the ones that had controlled well and had visual and audio oomph. 

One example is a typing game prototype I made, which I have dubbed Disco Typing. In Disco Typing, all the player has to do is type the words that show up on the screen. The twist is that when the player does well, visual and audio effects start to compound: the words start to flip and change color, the screen shakes at every key stroke, and disco music plays louder and louder. These effects, alongside with the tactile satisfaction of the keyboard, make the prototype one of my favorites to play. While me and my partner weren't able to implement any gameplay mechanics beyond a simple time trial, we were able to include the bonus scoring system I came up with. With this system, typing words accurately and speedily provides a bonus to score that boosts players more quicklyto their appropriate difficulty level.

After the 8 prototypes, 6 of the over 90 prototypes made for the class were selected by my professor and my peers to be polished over an additional 2 weeks. These prototypes were then presented to industry guests.

One of my prototypes was among the 6 selected for presentation. This game, Spincook, is a cooking-themed rhythm game controlled by spinning a wheel.
